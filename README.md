# ExpressQL - Express GraphQL API Start Kit
### Express.js + GraphQL + MongoDB + JWT Auth


#### 1. What is ExpressQL?
ExpressQL is a API start kit that bundles a bunch of features that almost every API needs. ExpressQL is written in Javascript following the ES6 convention.

ExpressQL uses the most popular Node.js web framework to deal with HTTP Requests: Express.js. The data flux is given by GraphQL, the default database is MongoDB and authentication uses JSON Web Token (JWT).
