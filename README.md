# Express GraphQL API Start Kit
### Express.js + GraphQL + MongoDB + JWT Auth


#### 1. What is ExpressQL?
ExpressQL is a API Start Kit that bundles a bunch of features that almost every API needs. ExpressQL is written in Javascript following the ES6 convention.

ExpressQL uses the most popular Node.js web framework to deal with HTTP Requests: Express.js. The data flux is given by GraphQL, the default database is MongoDB and authentication uses JSON Web Token (JWT).

With ExpressQL you only need to write your custom endpoints and you'll have in your hands a bunch of features like authentication, permissions, caching, file uploading and many others.
